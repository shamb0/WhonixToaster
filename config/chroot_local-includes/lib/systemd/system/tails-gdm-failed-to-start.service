Description=Guide the user when GDM fails to start
# GDM normally runs "plymouth --quit" when it fails to start the X server
# (see on_display_status_changed that calls plymouth_quit_without_transition).
# But when this happens we kill -9 GDM in our gdm-x-session wrapper, so it
# might not have time to quit plymouth yet. Therefore we ensure plymouth
# has quit before we start: we run after plymouth-quit.service (which is started
# by gdm.service's default OnFailure=), we have plymouth-quit-wait.service start,
# and we wait for it to complete.

# There are queued udev events when we run plymouthd so on Stretch, so
# watch_for_coldplug_completion will set up a watcher and return before
# there's any place where plymouthd can create a seat to display its
# splash and messages on. So we tell plymouthd to ignore udev which makes
# it create a fallback seat. The removal of this hack is tracked on #16964.
