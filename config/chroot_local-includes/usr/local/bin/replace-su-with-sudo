# In Tails, the administration password doesn't work with 'su'. New
# users in particular may be puzzled by the authentication failures
# while trying to 'su' using administration password.
#
# This script is called by '/etc/bash.bashrc.d/replace-su-with-sudo.sh'.
# It checks if the current user's password is set or not using
# 'is_password_set()' function from 'adminpassword.py' library. If the
# password is set, the user is asked to use 'sudo' instead of 'su'.
# Otherwise, the user is asked to first set the administration password.
