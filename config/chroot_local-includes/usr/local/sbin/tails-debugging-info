Debug Tails.

Test with "python3 tails-debugging-info.py doctest" as root.

goodcrypto.com converted from bash to python and added basic tests.

*** WARNING about debug_file and debug_directory *********************

Great attention must be given to the ownership situation of these
files and their parent directories in order to avoid a symlink-based
attack that could read the contents of any file and make it
accessible to the user running this script (typically the live
user). Therefore, when adding a new file, give as the first argument
'root' only if the complete path to it (including the file itself)
is owned by root and already exists before the system is connected to
the network (that is, before GDM's PostLogin script is run).
If not, the following rules must be followed strictly:

* only one non-root user is involved in the ownership situation (the
  file, its dir and the parent dirs). From now on let's assume it is
  the case and call it $USER.

* if any non-root group has write access, it must not have any
  members.

If any of these rules does not apply, the file cannot be added here
safely and something is probably quite wrong and should be
investigated carefully.
