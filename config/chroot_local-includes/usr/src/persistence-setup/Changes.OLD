    - Don't fix attributes on Tails system partition after creating
      or deleting partitions.

      We're going to backport the parted bugfix so this is not needed
      anymore. Rationale: we want t-p-s to do all its disk operations
      through udisks, so that the live user does not need write access
      to the Tails USB disk.
