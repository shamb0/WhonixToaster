Test suite
==========

Some parts of the test suite need to run some commands using
passwordless sudo. Most of it contents itself with cached sudo
credentials, but some parts change the TTY, so if the tty_tickets sudo
option is enabled, then one needs to explicitly allow running, as
root, using passwordless sudo, the following commands: /bin/chmod, /bin/mount, /bin/rm.
