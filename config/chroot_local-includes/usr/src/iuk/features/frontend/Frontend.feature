  As a Tails user
  I want to be guided through upgrading my Tails system, if needed

  Background:
    Given a Tails boot device
    And a trusted OpenPGP signing key pair
    And a HTTPS server with a valid SSL certificate

  Scenario: manually installed USB: no upgrade is available
    Given Tails is running from a manually installed USB thumb drive
    And no upgrade is available

    Given Tails is running from a manually installed USB thumb drive
    And no incremental upgrade is available, but a full upgrade is
    When I run tails-upgrade-frontend in batch mode
    Then it should succeed
    And I should be proposed to download this full upgrade

  Scenario: manually installed USB: both incremental and full upgrades are available
    Given Tails is running from a manually installed USB thumb drive
    And both incremental and full upgrades are available

    And I should be proposed to download this full upgrade
    And I should be told "your device was not created using a USB image or Tails Installer"

  Scenario: DVD: no upgrade is available
    Given Tails is running from a DVD
    And no upgrade is available

  Scenario: DVD: both incremental and full upgrades are available
    Given Tails is running from a DVD
    And both incremental and full upgrades are available
    When I run tails-upgrade-frontend in batch mode
    Then it should succeed
    And I should be proposed to download this full upgrade
    And I should be told "Tails was started from a DVD or a read-only device"

  Scenario: USB produced by our installer: no upgrade available
    Given Tails is running from a USB thumb drive
    And no upgrade is available
    When I run tails-upgrade-frontend
    Then it should succeed
    And I should be told "The system is up-to-date"

  Scenario: USB produced by our installer: cannot determine whether an upgrade is available
    Given Tails is running from a USB thumb drive
    And it is not known whether an upgrade is available
    When I run tails-upgrade-frontend
    Then it should fail to check for upgrades
    And I should be told "Could not determine whether an upgrade is available"
    And I should be pointed to the documentation about upgrade-description file retrieval error

  Scenario: USB produced by our installer: both incremental and full upgrades are available, but a target file does not exist
    Given Tails is running from a USB thumb drive
