# Sniffer is a very dumb wrapper to start and stop tcpdump instances, possibly
# with customized filters. Captured traffic is stored in files whose name
# depends on the sniffer name. The resulting captured packets for each sniffer
# can be accessed as an array through its `packets` method.
#
# Use of more rubyish internal ways to sniff a network like with pcap-able gems
# is waaay to much resource consuming, not much reliable and soooo slow. Let's
# not bother too much with that. :)
#
# Should put all that in a Module.
